        <p id="tribute-info">
          On <span class="date">12<sup>th</sup> December 1933</span>, Emmanuel
          N'Djoké "Manu" Dibango was born into a musical Protestant Christian
          household in Douala Cameroon. Here he discovered his talent for music
          as he sang at the local church where his mother was the choir leader.
          <br /><br />
          In <span class="date">1949</span>, Dibango was sent to continue his
          studies in France at the age of 15. At the age of 17, he started
          taking piano lessons and thereafter he learnt the saxophone. He joined
          a jazz band with noted Cameroonian guitarist and composer Francis
          Bebey and soon became a recognized entity within the local jazz
          circuit. <br /><br />
          In <span class="date">1959</span>, Dibango moved to Brussels where he
          learnt to play the vibraphone and it was then he started realising his
          ambition of fusing musical genres by merging jazz with African music.
          <br /><br />
          In <span class="date">1960</span>, Dibango toured Europe with ‘African
          Jazz’, a band led by a Congolese musician Joseph Kabesele who shared
          Dibango’s interest in musical fusion. After the tour, he followed
          Kabesele to Democratic Republic of Congo and stayed there for 3 years.
          <br /><br />
          In <span class="date">1963</span>, Dibango returned to his motherland
          Cameroon where he established his own band and continued to broaden
          his knowledge of African styles. Dibango returned to France in 1965,
          and in 1972, he released a song he had been commissioned to write for
          the African Cup of Nations football (soccer) match, “Soul Makossa”
          which ultimately marked the turning point in his career. <br /><br />
          In <span class="date">1973</span>, He toured internationally with the
          American salsa band the Fania All Stars. Several years later, he
          released albums like Gone Clear (1980) and Ambassador (1980), Home
          Made (1978), featuring Nigerian and Ghanaian musicians, and Waka Juju
          (1982). Dibango also composed music for film and television.
          <br /><br />
          In <span class="date">1990</span>, he published his autobiography,
          "Three Kilos of Coffee" (originally in French), with Danielle Rouard.
          Harbouring a deep and ongoing concern for the well-being of humanity,
          he often used his music and his influence to garner support for
          various humanitarian causes. <br /><br />
          In <span class="date">2004</span>, In recognition of his contributions
          to the development of music as well as his cultivation of
          cross-cultural dialogue—particularly between Europe, Africa, and North
          America—through the arts, he was named the UNESCO Peace Artist of the
          Year. <br /><br />
          On <span class="date">24<sup>th</sup> March 2020</span>, Dibango died
          after contracting COVID-19. <br /><br /><br />
